# HoN-Modding-Guide
A compilation of resources for HoN modding. Many are just salvaged from old Wikis that no longer exist and pulled into one place.

Access to the HoN forums can be unreliable and some old posts are no longer accessible by the various hyperlinks you may find in the wild. Other great resources (such as http://honwiki.net/wiki/Modding) are no longer directly accessible without the use of the Wayback Machine on WebArchive.org (e.g. http://web.archive.org/web/20150321004731/http://honwiki.net/wiki/Category:Modding).

As such, I decided to pull together the resources into a single, more coherent location for my own use. But hopefully it may help others who wish to keep HoN and its various mods alive even after Frostburn/S2 have stopped providing primary support for the game.
