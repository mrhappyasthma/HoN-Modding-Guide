[Heroes of Newerth (HoN)](https://www.heroesofnewerth.com/) is a video game created by S2 games and eventually sold to Frostburn Studios. As of [patch 4.7.3](https://forums.heroesofnewerth.com/showthread.php?611162-4-7-3-Reverts-amp-Mass-Long-term-Stability-Balance), announced 02-16-2019, the game has been places in a "maintenance mode" where it will not have any more active development and will only receive scarce patches to fix game breaking issues. No new content is expected at this time.

Fortunately, since the beginning, HoN has always allowed [modding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modding) of the game client. A list of existing mods and other resources can be found on the [forums](https://forums.heroesofnewerth.com/forumdisplay.php?290-Bots-and-Modifications).
